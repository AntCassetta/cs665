CS665 Refrigerator Raider

This project concept and the foundations of design are the results of teamwork through class CS633. 
Refrigerator Raider is a web-based application designed for both personal and commercial refrigerator inventory management.
The app allows users to input products and related quantities into an online virtual refrigerator
and receive alerts when items are running low.

I have taken the project and rewriten the implimentation in Java, CS633 version used javaScript, 
in order to further my own abilities and satisfy the requirments of CS665.
